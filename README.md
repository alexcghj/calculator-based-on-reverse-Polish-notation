 1 The size of the input data cannot exceed 2500 characters.
 2 There should be support for floating point numbers.
 3 The developed calculator should support the following operations: +, -, /, *, ^ ( exponentiation), %, ().
4 To implement this software, it is mandatory to use a stack and/or queue. 
 5 Each element of this structure must be created dynamically (using the malloc function).
 6 The program must be run from the console and support the processing of the input argument, which is a mathematical expression.
 7 If there is no input argument, the program starts an interactive mode of operation, which expects a mathematical expression.
 8 If the mathematical expression contains errors, the program prints "Error parse".
 9 There may be spaces between the characters.
 10 The response is printed to the console, at the end the translation to a new line is not performed.
 11 If the answer is a floating point number, then 7 numbers after the decimal point are output.
